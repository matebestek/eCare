			use = <"Use to record the details about any generic device that may be used either directly in a therapeutic or diagnostic manner or indirectly to support provision of healthcare. Use of the term device varies depending on context.  Within the Standards world, the term device tends to refer to mechanical or electronic devices that  support healthcare and require rigorous docuumentation regarding specifications, maintenance etc.  Within the terminology context the use of device is very broad, including any physical object that can be used in direct or indirect provision of clinical care.  Examples include ventilator circuits, peak flow meters, spirometers, eyeglasses and contact lenses, intravascular catheters, breast implants, prostheses, drain tubes and corn rings.
This archetype is designed to provide the basis for a structured representation of any device, from a simple example of a brand of urinary dipstick with a current 'use by' date through to an implanted bionic ear that may require complex documentation re software, hardware, maintenance, calibration etc.
For common use cases, it may be appropriate to specialise this archetype specifically eg intravascular catheter or urinary catheter.">
