			purpose = <"To record clinical observations regarding responsiveness of a subject to stimuli as an objective assessment of the conscious state of a subject. ">
			use = <"Use in any clinical situation to assess the level of consciousness of a subject, with the exception of infants and young children.
The three response values are considered separately as well as their sum. The minimum possible Total score value is 3 and the maximum possible is 15.
The Total score can be derived as the sum of the recorded scores for each of the eye, motor and verbal responses. 
The EMV score can be derived as a composite from each of the recorded response scores, for example E3 M2 V4 represents the conscious state of a subject who opens eyes to speech, has an extensor response to pain and utters incomprehensible sounds.
If any one of the eye, motor or verbal responses cannot be assessed - for example if the subject is intubated and not able to respond verbally, or paralysed and not able to provide a motor response - the score recorded for the response is 1 and a modifier attached. If the subject is intubated the verbal response component can be represented as V1t, where t = tube, or V1Intubated. If the subject has severe facial/eye swelling or injuries and can't open their eyes, the eye response component can be represented as E1c, where c=closed. Often the numeric one is omitted, so the eye response component can be expressed more simply as Ec, for example Ec M2 V4.
Clinical Decision support should be based upon each of the specific records of eye, motor and verbal responses and the explicit statements that a response cannot be assessed, rather than the derived and composite EMV score.">
