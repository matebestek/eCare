Multi-analyte panels can be represented using templates or specialised archetypes.
 
More complex tests such as histopathology or microbiology should be represented using specialised archetypes where additional report content is required.

			misuse = <"Not to be used for reporting on non-pathology test results e.g. diagnostic imaging, ECG or respiratory function tests.

Not to be used to represent an entire cumulative report. This Pathology test result archetype represents only one of the result sets that is usually viewed as a vertical in a cumulative test report. A cumulative report is a view that is constructed from the results represented by multiple OBSERVATION archetypes.

This archetype is suitable for representation of general pathology test results, but not intended to cover full synoptic reports. For these, additional specialising archetypes are required to represent the data.">
