			purpose = <"To demonstrate a design pattern for representation of an Adverse Reaction List.">
			use = <"Use to support the representation of statements about known adverse reactions that have been recorded PLUS to make positive statements about the absence of adverse reactions - either general statements of absence or specific statements of absence of an adverse reaction to a specific substance.

The existence of known adverse reactions can be persisted in records.

Statements about the absence of adverse reactions, either general or specific, can only indicate the state of the subject at the time that the information was actually recorded - that is, they are event based. It is not sensible to persist the recording of a positive absence of an adverse reaction as an adverse reaction that occurs on administration of any substance may render any or all previous positive statements of absence obsolete. In clinical practice this is synonymous with asking a patient if they have a reaction to any medications or substances prior to any and every administration of a medication or substance.

It is possible to represent both positive statements about identified adverse reactions alongside specific positive statements about the absence of identified problems/diagnoses in a template (eg patient has had an adverse reaction to tetracycline but never had a reaction to penicillin. However in most use cases either specific statements about the presence of identified adverse reactions (eg patient has had reactions to tetracycline and sticking plaster) or general statements about the positive absence of any known problems/diagnoses will be represented (eg No known adverse reactions), but not both. 

While EVALUATION.adverse and EVALUATION.exclusion-adverse archetypes and their specialisations have been explicitly included in the slot constraints, other archetypes have not been explicitly excluded. This means that any other archetypes can also be included here, if needed - for example, where structured data is not available or there is a need to provide a synopis, the EVALUATION.clinical_synopsis can be inserted and used.">
