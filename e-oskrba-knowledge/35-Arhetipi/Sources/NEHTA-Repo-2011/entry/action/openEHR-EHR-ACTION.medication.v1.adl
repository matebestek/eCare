This will usually be in response to a medication order but may be administered immediately without an order at times, thus requiring recording of the administration alone (e.g. in an emergency situation). 

Such a record may be made to indicate the administration of a dose, dispensing of a certain quantity or as a record of ceasing a medication. The state of the medication instruction is altered by the action taken as indicated in the Pathway definition.

There is a date and time at which this ACTION took place (as there is for all ACTIONs)  and use of this archetype indicates that some action has actually occurred.">
