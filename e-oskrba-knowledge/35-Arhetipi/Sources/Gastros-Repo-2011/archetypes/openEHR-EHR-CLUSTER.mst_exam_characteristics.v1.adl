The characteristics of examination refer to the extent and limit of the examination.  Extent of the examination is defined as the anatomic extent of the examination.  Limit of the examination is defined as any limitation that impedes adequate execution of the procedure.  It is recognized that there is some overlap in the concept of extent and limit.  The intent of this section is to convey in an explicit manner those characteristics of the examination that affect the completeness of the examination,  any limitations that prevent a complete examination and any maneuvers necessary to execute a complete examination.

Extent of the examination is specified by the furthest anatomic site reached or a list of the anatomic sites visualized.  For colonoscopy, if the cecum is reached, then the anatomic site \"cecum\" specifies the extent of examination.  For ERCP, if only the biliary tree is visualized, then it is necessary to specify that the extent of the examination was the biliary tree.

Limit of examination is specified by any restrictions on the examination that are the result of inadequate preparation, anatomic anomalies or barriers. In colonoscopy the quality of bowel cleansing is a major factor for the quality of the procedure, especially when small and flat lesions are sought.  Poor preparation is considered a limit of the examination.  Stenosis of the segment of the gastrointestinal tract that requires intervention to complete an examination is also considered a limit of the examination.  For example, stenosis precludes the passage of the endoscope but dilation permits the instrument to be advanced. This is also the case for ERCP, where part of the endoscopic report should describe the various maneuvers which were performed to obtain cannulation and/or opacification of the ducts.">
